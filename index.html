        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>
          Palestinian Voices in Games is an initiative to support current and emerging Palestinian indie game developers in the production of their
          games. It is a network of diverse international game professionals volunteering their time, work, and expertise to make these projects a
          reality.

        <h2>WHY</h2>
        <p>
          Through our work in the creative industries we learned of the power of having our voice heard; through past struggles we have learned the
          importance of amplifying the voices of those who have not yet been heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dehumanisation of Palestinians is tied to their rare visibility in the cultural sphere. This dehumanisation costs livesâ€“as the world
          remains indifferent to the ongoing genocide in Gaza and to the surge of violent oppression across the West Bank and inside Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians, not simply through representation but also through professional and economic
          support, so that Palestinian game developers may tell their own stories and reach global audiences. Inspired by the work of intellectuals,
          poets, actors, artists, and game developers such as Edward Said, Mahmoud Darwish, Hiam Abbas, Larissa Sansour, Elia Suleiman, and Rasheed
          Abueideh, we want to support a new generation of Palestinian gamemakers.

      <section class="my-5">
        <h2>How</h2>
        <p>
          We are currently expanding our international volunteer network, meeting Palestinian developers looking for support, and connecting with
          potential funding partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our next step is to bring these parts together in collaboration. We will connect Palestinian game developers with volunteers and funding
          partners who can offer them the assistance they need. We will also provide administrative support to help them coordinate volunteer
          resources and navigate the initial stages of funding conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to ensure that funding and volunteer support are effectively utilized. We will assist supported creators in managing the
          financial resources they secure and in coordinating the delivery of volunteer contributions. From production to announcement to publication,
          we will follow the progress of each project closely, keeping all supporters informed every step of the way.

          around the world. We first convened in May 2024 and have been building this project since. We are a self-organised group looking for
