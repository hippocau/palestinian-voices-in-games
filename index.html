            <h2>What are we trying to do</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Palestinian Voices in Games</em> is an initiative to support current and emerging Palestinian indie creators in the creation of their games and to organise a network
                of diverse international professionals, volunteering with work hours to support the development of their projects.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="my-5">
            <h2>WHY WE DO THIS?</h2>
            <p>
                As workers of the cultural industry we know the power of having a voice in games, in art and entertainment; through past struggles we
                have learned the importance of amplifying the voice of those who are not yet heard.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we call for a cease fire in the current war, we recognize that Palestinian liberation is a longer and ongoing battle. <strong>The dehumanisation
                of Palestinians is tied to their rare visibility in the cultural sphere.</strong> This dehumanisation costs lives - as the world remains indifferent to
                the unfolding genocide in Gaza and to the surge of violent oppression across the West Bank and inside Israel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our action wants to push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians, not simply through representation but also through professional and economic support, 
                so that they may carve a space for themselves in world culture. Inspired by great intellectuals like Edward Said, poets like Mahmoud Darwish, actress Hiam Abbas, 
                artist Larissa Sansour, filmmakers Elia Suleiman or game developers like Rasheed Abueideh;
                <strong>we want to support a new generation of Palestinian gamemakers entering the stage.</strong>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="my-5">
            <h2>What is the time frame</h2>
            <p>
                We are currently working on parallel tracks, looking for funding partners, building a bureaucratic infrastructure, expanding the volunteer network,
                and getting in touch with Palestinian creatives in need of this support.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a second phase we will start collecting funding and the volunteer work hours available. We will also coordinate with the Palestinian creators
                to organise support depending on their needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a third phase, we will allocate the fundings and organise the provision of volunteer hours. We did not yet set up the process of application
                and distribution of the fundings.
            </p>
            <p>
                From production to presentation, to publication we will follow the developments of the projects, and keep the supporters informed.
            </p>

            <h2>Who are we</h2>
            <p>
                We are a large network of established game makers and creators, game studios, curators and event organisers from around the world. We originally
                convened in May 2024 and have been building this project since. We are a self-organised group looking for partners ready to engage time, finances and energy into this action.
