          By comic artist <strong>Iasmin Omar Ata</strong>, also known as Delta. <em>Being 2</em> is a point & click visual novel set in a
          futuristic Palestinian space-colony. It is a sequel to their previous game, <em>Being</em>, an abstract adventure game about Palestinian
          life during the past century, ranging from perpetual grief to enduring hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iasmin is currently working on the first prototype of the game and is looking for support from game producers and in setting up
          crowdfunding.
