          By <strong>Yusra</strong>. Yusra is a designer and independent researcher with an interest in moral psychology and decision-making. She is
          currently developing RiYafa, a game that combines testimony and symbolism to tell the story of her family and community based in the West
          Bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is set in a dark, underwater world that players will have to explore and find their way through. As they navigate these waters,
          they will discover testimonies from Palestinians and see how their land is still being stolen and colonized today.
